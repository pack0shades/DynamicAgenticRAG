Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the system_answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the system_answer completely and helpfully addresses the user_question.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The system_answer is terrible: completely irrelevant to the question asked, or very partial
2: The system_answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the question
3: The system_answer is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
